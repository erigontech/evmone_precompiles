  [#264](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/264)

## [0.7.1] — 2022-02-15

### Fixed

- Added support for `bswap()` of small unsigned types: `uint8_t`, `uint16_t` and `uint32_t`.
  Previously arguments where promoted to `uint64_t` what produced invalid results.
  [#247](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/247)

## [0.7.0] — 2021-12-17

### Changed

- The `int128.hpp` and `intx.hpp` header files have been merged. Now the whole
  library is included in single [`intx/intx.hpp`](./include/intx/intx.hpp) file.
  [#242](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/242)
- The `addmod()` implementation has the optimized path for elliptic curve context.
  [#206](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/206)

  [#245](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/245)


## [0.6.0] — 2021-06-25

### Changed

- **The internal representation of unsigned integers has been changed to be an array of 64-bit words. This provides types composed of any number of words** (e.g. `uint384`). 
  Previously only power-of-two numbers of words were allowed.
  This is a big change that affects implementation of many operators.
  [#212](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/212)
  [#213](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/213)
- Subtraction has been slightly rewritten to make it easier for compilers to optimize it.
  The performance now matches the addition.
  [#189](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/189)
- Multiplication API has been cleaned up by using
  [`std::is_constant_evaluated`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_constant_evaluated)-like helpers internally.
  [#195](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/195)
  [#205](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/205)
- Shift API has been changed to use `uint64_t` as shift amount on the fundamental API level.
  [#202](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/202)


## [0.5.1] — 2020-12-14

  [#108](https://github.com/chfast/intx/pull/108)


## [0.3.0] — 2019-06-20

### Added
